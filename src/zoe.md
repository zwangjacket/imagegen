# Zoé Cordelier et le Portail de Genève.

Zoé had just settled into her first real job orbiting CERN
when she stumbled on an anomalous data stream inside an internal cloud stack.
The album focused on her disorientation, her technical intuition,
and the discovery of an exotic matter gateway hidden behind respectable research language.
Theme was awakening and the cost of curiosity.

# Les Ombres du Nuage CERN.
Zoé was recruited under pressure into operations and incident response as the gateway destabilized.
She learned that CERN ran its own cloud for reasons that had nothing to do with latency.
Theme was systems, responsibility, and how invisible labor kept dangerous power contained.

# Terre Parallèle ZH-17.
Captured by the project leadership,
Zoé was sent as a scout to a parallel Earth frozen in late twentieth century geopolitics.
She had to survive with limited tools, relying on math, observation, and restraint.
Theme was isolation and the price of being useful.

# La porte de l'enfer

# Diane de Ferney.
The album slowed down and centered on her relationship with Diane during the lockdown years.
Power dynamics, discipline, enforced presentation,
and structured intimacy reshaped Zoé into someone more functional and more exposed.
Theme was control as care and desire as structure.

# Les Femmes du Cercle.
Zoé was introduced to Diane’s network of influential lesbian women across architecture, policy, and science.
She learned how power really circulated and how to survive rooms where everyone was sharper than she was.
Theme was mentorship, hierarchy, and chosen lineage.

# L’Incident de Matière Exotique.
A catastrophic failure inside the gateway killed several senior figures and left Zoé blamed and indispensable at the same time.
She had to lead under scrutiny, presenting authority she did not feel.
Theme was impostor syndrome versus earned competence.

# Les Filles de Poséidon.
Zoé was sent to an oceanic parallel world where post human societies lived underwater.
The cover depicted her first contact with them.
Theme was otherness, femininity, and adapting her rigid training to fluid environments.

# La Scout Insubmersible.
Now an experienced explorer, Zoé began bending orders, protecting worlds from exploitation,
and quietly sabotaging extraction efforts.
Diane’s influence clashed with her growing autonomy.
Theme was moral agency and rebellion within systems.

# Zoé Cordelier, Architecte des Passages.
Zoé confronted the project leadership and redesigned the gateway network itself,
turning it from a colonial instrument into a regulated exchange.
She stepped into her own authority, no longer hiding behind punk distance or borrowed rules.
Theme was authorship, synthesis, and choosing who she became.
